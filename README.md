Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Overview

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward neural network that transforms input data through multiple layers using weights, biases, and activation functions. It is widely used for tasks such as classification, regression, and function approximation.

How the MLP Works

Each layer in the MLP performs the following steps:

Computes a weighted sum of its inputs.

Adds a bias term.

Passes the result through a non-linear activation function.

Uses regularization techniques to improve performance and prevent overfitting.

Activation Function

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. 

Forward Pass

During the forward pass, data flows through the network in the following manner:

Input Layer: Receives raw data.

Hidden Layers: Apply transformations using weights, biases, and activation functions.

Output Layer: Produces final predictions based on the learned representations.

Weight Initialization & Regularization

MLPs use various weight initialization strategies to accelerate training and improve convergence. Regularization techniques include:

Dropout: Randomly deactivates neurons to reduce overfitting.

Batch Normalization: Standardizes layer inputs to improve stability.

Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:

pip install numpy torch tensorflow

Running the Model

You can train and test the MLP using the following command:

python train.py
